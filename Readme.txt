Class Project

Provided the GUI for Tetris using the Swing library in Java. 
Backend code for the game mechanics was provided by the instructor and
located in the model package. All other code relating to the frontend 
and any special features was done by me.

This Tetris has two versions that the user can choose from, a "boring" version
with black and white, and a "less boring" version with a Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy theme (the rights to Hitchhiker's Guide belong to Douglas Adams, of
course). Features: 
    - Optional grid sizes.
    - Instant replay of previous game. 
    - Able to play multiple games in a row, with start, pause, and stop options.
    - Custom images.
    - Increased difficulty upon leveling up.
    - Ability to change grid size or theme without closing program.
    - Executable JAR file.
    - Resizing of window via dragging the corner also resizes the game board. 
      (Note: the HGG theme resizes slowly due to image size; this is an issue 
      to be fixed in the future.)

Tested project in Windows 10 OS.
